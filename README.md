# Project 2 Statistical Calculator
##### Completed by Angela Murphy by herself. Sources are listed throughout the code when used.

#### This project consists of a Statistical Calculator using pycharm for IS 601 at NJIT. Listed below are the following requirements that were implemented.

* Creating a Mean, Median and Mode for the calculator, as well as Variance and Standard Deviation.
* Program Requirements include those descriptive statistics functions including a random generator function.
* Random generator function must generate a random number without a seed between a range of two numbers, Generate a random number with a seed between a range of two numbers and generate a list of N random numbers with a seed and between a range of numbers. All both integer and decimal.
* Program includes demonstrations of inheritance by extending the calculator, encapsulation by having the calculator methods and result properties.
* Demonstrates abstraction, check values for being valid numbers and not strings
* Throwing an exception for divide by zero and empty list
* Uses random data for tests.
